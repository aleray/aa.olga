It felt necessary to "fork" the library as we wanted to adapt it to version django
models. It is at the moment tighlty coupled with tastypie and our API Resource,
this is why the code lives in the otherwise AGPL licensed olga.

Thanks for the original authors Arne Brodowski and Jannis Leidel for providing
this elegant code base.
